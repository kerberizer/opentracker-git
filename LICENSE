beerware

The beerware license is very open, close to public domain, but insists
on honoring the original author by just not claiming that the code is
yours. Instead assume that someone writing Open Source Software in the
domain youâ€™re obviously interested in would be a nice match for having a
beer with.

So, just keep the name and contact details intact and if you ever meet
the author in person, just have an appropriate brand of sparkling
beverage choice together. The conversation will be worth the time for
both of you.
